    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers.

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** Because of the large number of features KNN does not sound like a good option based on [1], as it suffers from curse of dimensionality. Based on [2], I am going to use two Ensemble methods: AdaBoost and Random Forest, as decision trees can naturally represent many categorical variables that exist in our model. Also, I am going to use Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Gaussian Naive Bayes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier is a popular (baseline) method for text categorization, the problem of judging documents as belonging to one category or the other (such as spam or legitimate, sports or politics, etc.) with word frequencies as the features [3]. The advantages are that the method is simple and fast. It makes assumption about conditional independence of features given the class. If the assumption holds it converges quicky. If it does not, Naive Bayes still performs well in practice [4]. The disadvantage is that it cannot learn interactions between features. Our problem has some simiarities with the way spam detection is formulated. In both problems there exist a large number of categorical variables and in both Precision is one of the most important metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Random Forest*\n",
    "\n",
    "RF has application in remote sensing, among others [5]. RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting [5]. A disadvantage is that ensembles of decision trees (such as Random Forests) are very fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once trained [6]. More accurate ensembles require more trees, which means using the model becomes slower. Decision trees are a natural model for many categorical variables (the case in our problem). But they tend to overfit to data, and that's where ensemble methods (like RF) come in to make the model more generalizable [4]. RF handles high dimensionality pretty well and that is why it has been chosen here. \n",
    "\n",
    "*AdaBoost* \n",
    "\n",
    "One important application of AdaBoost is in text categorization such that what an automatic help desk does based on what the customer says [7]. Advantages include: being fast, simple and easy to program, no parameters needed to tune (except T), flexible (can combine with any learning algorithm) and no prior knowledge needed about weak learner. Disadvantages are that performance of AdaBoost depends on data and weak learner. If the weak learner is too complex, AdaBoost is prone to overfitting, and if it is too weak it may underfit the data [7]. AdaBoost with decision stumps (unit depth decision trees) have shown to perform well in practice and that is why it is chosen here. \n",

    "**Answer: ** AdaBoost classifier is the most appropriate for this problem from the three models that are chosen. It has the highest F-score on the testing set when 1%, 10% or 100% of the data has been chosen, so it is the most consistent classifier among the three. Also, it has the same score in both training set and the testing set (when 10% and 100% of the data is used), which means that it generalizes well for the data, unlike Random Forest that is overfitting to the training set and has a much lower score for the testing set. AdaBoost has also the highest accuracy score on the testing set (botton middle figure) although it is close to RF. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training and testing times are highest for AdaBoost (more than double of RF time). But because all the times are still in the range of a few seconds, that should not cause a problem for this size of data. If the size of training and testing data increases it might be beneficial to use another algorithm, e.g., RF with better tuning to avoid overfitting. \n",

    "**Answer: ** AdaBoost algorithm starts by using simple classifiers that can predict results just slightly better than by chance (a.k.a. weak learners), then focuses more on the data that it has predicted incorrectly and combines the results. The base classifier here is a unit depth decision tree which divides the data based on many categorical features that we have. Then it assigns a higher weight on the data that has predicted incorrectly and continues the same sequence for a number of times before converging. \n",

These weights can be used to inform the training of the weak learner, for instance, decision trees can be grown that favor splitting sets of samples with high weights [1]. In order to predict, the output of the weak learners is combined into a weighted sum (based on their accuracy) that represents the final output of the boosted classifier [1]. \n",

Age is also relevant because one should perhaps be in their 30-50's to potentially make >50K. Hour-per-week is related because the more one works the more they will make. Education-level-Bachelors is also relevant because Bachelors seems to be the lowest level when people can make more than 50K."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

F-score is not as close on the reduced data but still pretty good given that we are only using five among 131 features. So if we care about training time, we definitely need to consider using the reduced number of features instead of all of them. "
